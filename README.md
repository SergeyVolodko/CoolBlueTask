## Simple CRUD API

This project demonstrates production-level code I write in everyday work.

Covered topics:
1. Production-ready Api code and infrastructure
2. CRUD functionality of primitive Web shop with only Products and Sales combinations. Ready for extension.

The application has classic N-tier architecture with Controllers, Services and Repository layers.
Coding is done sticking to TDD so every row of the code has it's own test before it got actually written.

## Used tools and open-source dependencies
### Infrustructure
- The Service utilizes `Autofac` nuget for Dependency injection
- Exceptions are handled and logged using `NLog`
- Authorization implemented via `Auth0` jwt tokens and proved by [integration tests](https://github.com/SergeyVolodko/CoolBlueTask/blob/master/CoolBlueTask.Tests/AuthorizationIntegrationTests.cs)
- Configurations consumed from `Web.config`
- Help page generated by `Swagger`

### Functionality implementation
- Testing libs `xUnit`, `AutoFixture`, `NSubstitute` and `ApprovalTests`
- Mappings handled using `AutoMapper` lib
- Validations implemented with `FluentValidations`
- Repository layer works against SQLite database (InMemory for flexibility). Utilizing micro ORM `Simple.Data`
Functionality proved with [integration tests](https://github.com/SergeyVolodko/CoolBlueTask/blob/master/CoolBlueTask.Tests/Products/ProductRepositoryIntegrationTests.cs)
